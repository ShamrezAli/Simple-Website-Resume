      <p>My name is Shamrez and I'm a Geoscience major with an interest in all things technology, 
        literature and computer software. I've always been fascinated with the newest tech, and I 
        love working with computers. Whether it's building my own computer, tinkering around in the 
        settings and BIOS, or testing out the limits of the software, I enjoy seeing how far I can push 
        my knowledge about this subject. I'm also an avid reader, an aspiring writer and love coming up 
        with interesting stories in my head.</p>
      <h3>This is my first website! I created it on January 2nd, 2022 when I decided to learn a little more 
        about programming and tinkering with my new computer.</h3>
      <p>I hope this is just the first of many. It isn't too fancy but I had a lot of fun working on it.</p>
