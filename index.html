              <p>My name is Shamrez and I'm a Geoscience major with an interest in all things technology, 
                literature and computer software. I've always been fascinated with the newest tech, and I 
                love working with computers. Whether it's building my own computer, tinkering around in the 
                settings and BIOS, or testing out the limits of the software, I enjoy seeing how far I can push 
                my knowledge about this subject. I'm also an avid reader, an aspiring writer and love coming up 
                with interesting stories in my head.</p>
              <h3>This is my first website! I created it on January 2nd, 2022 when I decided to learn a little more 
                about programming and tinkering with my new computer.</h3>
              <p>I hope this is just the first of many. It isn't too fancy but I had a lot of fun working on it.</p>

                <p>I'm Shamrez and I like working on PC's. This website was created by myself using various HTML and 
                  CSS tutorials I could find on the web.</p>
                <p>I'm 21 years old and I enjoy learning about the exciting new software that is always being worked 
                  on such as various Linux distros. I also enjoy learning about how computer parts work such as RAM 
                  modules and the power supply. Through my years of high school I always wanted to be a writer so I 
                  also have a large vocabulary and am adept at using my words. </p>

                <p>I hope to use my talents at working with both hardware and software to achieve a career that allows 
                  me to work with computers full time.</p>
                <p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
